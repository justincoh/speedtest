speedtest --format=json

The naming conventions between CSV and JSON output change, which is confusing

The JSON format contains much more (and needed) data than the csv format
best bet is probably to run this with the --format=json, then parse the results and write them to a csv

to go from byte to mbit is * .000008 or 8e-6

you'll want result.download.bandwidth
result.upload.bandwidth
packetLoss maybe
result.result.url
result.timestamp
result.isp
result.server.location
